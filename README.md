# A simulator for Bacterial Genome-wide Association studies (BacGWASim)
# Motivation
Identification of genomic elements underlying bacterial phenotypes such as resistance to antibiotics, virulence and fermentation is a fundamental step for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these traits, and may be able to inform new clinical, industrial and agricultural interventions. So far several methods for Bacterial Genome-wide association study (GWAS) have been devised to tackle this challenge, however, due to unique characteristics of bacterial genome, each of the methods have been shown to have certain limitations. 

BacGWASim is designed to simulate whole-genomes and phenotypes of large bacterial populations focusing on unique characteristics of bacteria such as strong genome-wide linkage disequilibrium and homoplasy events, which affects the power of bacterial GWAS tools. The data produced by BacGWASim provides a mean to 1) evaluate the power and limitations of existing bacterial GWAS methods, 2) develop and benchmark novel tools for bacterial GWAS.
