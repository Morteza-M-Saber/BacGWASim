# A simulator for Bacterial Genome-wide Association studies (BacGWASim)
# Motivation
Identification of genomic elements underlying bacterial phenotypes such as restistance to antibiotics, virulence and fermentation is a fundamental step to better understand the molecular mechanisms of these traits and pave the way for the development of novel genetially engineered microorganisms for new clinical, agricultural and industrial purposes.
